            . My responsibility was primarily to draw some complex shapes on
            the web browser.
            <br/>
            . Designed and implemented GroupShape, Table and Chart frameworks. I
            also had fun working on intricate animations and transitions like

            . Implemented a Alogorithm for Smart shapes and developed with a team of 2 engineers.
